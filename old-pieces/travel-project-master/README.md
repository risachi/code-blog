The Portland Activities site will help people find suggestions for fun local attractions that are filtered for what they're interested in doing against what attractions are open and the appropriate age range for the group they're with.  Users will be able to find pricing, location, how physically intensive the attraction(s) can be, and whether the attraction is primarily indoor or outdoor to help tailor results for what they're looking for. The site provides links to attraction websites to simplify navigation and trip planning.
